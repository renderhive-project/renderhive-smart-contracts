# Renderhive Smart Contract

## About the Renderhive Project

This project was created to establish the first fully decentralized crowdrendering platform for [Blender](https://www.blender.org) built on the Web3 technologies of [Hedera Hashgraph](https://www.hedera.com/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) / [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io). The aim is to gather the latent CPU/GPU power of the Blender community by creating a free marketplace where Blender artists can buy and sell rendering time on each others computers in times they don't need it for their own projects.

## About this repository

This repository contains the open source code of the Renderhive Smart Contract. This is the central contract that will establish trust between the nodes of the Renderhive network. It will manage the payment flows between users,

### Contributing

Please note that the current version of the contract is just a test contract with very preliminary function calls, which are merely used to test the [Renderhive Service App](https://github.com/renderhive-projects/renderhive-service-app). The development of the actual contract is part of the [project roadmap](https://renderhive.io). If you want to contribute, feel free to create an issue to discuss the first steps of the smart contract implementation.
